Section 2 Eniac market launch Brazil

This README is used for section 2 of DATA004 WBS course.

It describes the projects and exercises around company Eniac.

In section 1 we learned about the history and company values, as well as strategy from Eniac.

The target was to give a recommendation regarding a collaboration with an SaaS comany called Magist.

Our recommendation after analysis of a data snapshot from Magist was not to sign a contract with them but to search for other provider.
